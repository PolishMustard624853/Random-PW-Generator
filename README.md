Random Password Generator Homework

This assignment required a user to create a random password with at least one parameter selected that was prompted to them after clicking the "Generate Password" button.

To start writing the code I first input all of the values in javascript so that upon clicking the "Generate Password" button they were prompted a series of messages asking what parameters they want to incorporate in their password. 

If the user did not choose a length between 8-128 characters, they were informed via prompt message that their password must be 8-128 charachters long in order to receive a password.

Then, if the user did not choose any of the specified "lowercase", "uppercase", "special characters" or "numeric values", they were then informed via prompt message stating that they must choose at least one of the parameters in order to continue, looping the questions until one was specified.

Then, I couldn't get the password to appear on the page. I have to come back to this assignment and figure out what isn't working properly so that the user can have their generated password and be content with the page.

Coming back to this assignment I believe I might have been committing to the wrong branch....
